==============================

A Timeline.js based timeline of GLBT history in RI.  

This is based on Balance Media's Timeline.js, created in partnership with John Keefe of WNYC. Here's the repository:

I wanted to try out Timeline.js, and gay marriage was passed in Rhode Island today.  I noticed that the Providence Journal
published a timeline of GLBT history, but it was text only (http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2013/05/a-timeline-of-gay-and-lesbian-history-in-rhode-island-and-nationally.html)

I used this as the base data, and loaded it into a Google spreadsheet that populates the timeline. 
The spreadsheet is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ApLwuu1HQNO7dDVkNksyLXA4ckRxbGpwX254dkhPV1E&output=html

And the end result is here:

I created a highly-illustrated tutorial of the process of creating a Timeline.js based timeline here:

Thanks to John Keefe of WNYC, Balance Media, and Jonathan Soma, creator of Tabletop.js, which Timeline also uses.
